## 📱 Overview

This is a mobile movie browsing app built with **React Native** using **Expo**. The project was developed as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of building a complete mobile app.

The app uses **NativeWind** to apply Tailwind CSS-style utility classes in React Native, enabling consistent and responsive UI styling.

Data is fetched from **The Movie Database (TMDB)** using two main API endpoints:
- `/movie/popular`: Fetches a list of popular movies
- `/search/movie`: Searches for movies by keyword
- `/movie/{movie_id}`: Retrieves detailed information about a selected movie

## 🧱 App Structure

The app includes five main screens:

- **Home**: Displays a grid of popular movies
- **Search**: Allows users to search for movies using keywords
- **MovieDetails**: Shows detailed information for a selected movie
- **Save** *(not implemented)*: Placeholder for saved/favorite movies
- **Profile** *(not implemented)*: Placeholder for user profile

Only **Home**, **Search**, and **MovieDetails** are functional. Save and Profile are part of the navigation but were left unimplemented, as the goal was to focus on the fundamentals of app development.
